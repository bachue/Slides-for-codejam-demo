# BUS with Solr

##### Author: Rongz

---
## Three Search Engines

* Sphinx
* Solr
* ElasticSearch

---
## Sphinx

* By Sphinx Technologies Inc.
* Written in C++
* MySQL Interface
* Easy to config and use

---
#### Pros

* Good Performance

#### Cons

* Can't compare between 2 strings ( Necessary for us ! )

---
## Solr

* By Apache
* Written in Java
* XML Style
* Flexible config
* Flexible Query DSL

---
## ElasticSearch

* By Apache too
* Written in Java too
* JSON Style
* Query by JSON

---
## Why I chose Solr

* Unclear doc of ElasticSearch
* Always confused with JSON Query
* But I love DSL of Solr
